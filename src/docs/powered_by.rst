Testimonials
------------

    "At Square, we have a large git repo with hundreds of projects. We
    build and ship from a master branch that gets hundreds of commits
    daily. Pants gives our developers a faster and more reliable
    incremental build experience than Maven in this environment.

    One particular problem our users faced was integrating with
    IntelliJ. Previously, developers were stuck waiting long times for
    Maven to refresh the IDE configuration, or had to install binary
    versions of projects which quickly go out of date. Both the pants
    plugin for IntelliJ and the idea goal make it easy for users to
    switch between git branches and different projects within the repo
    freely without worrying about taking a productivity hit to
    reconfigure their IDE." -- Eric Ayers, Square
